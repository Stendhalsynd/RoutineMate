# S0-2 Domain Scoring Core

## Given
- Users submit quick meal and workout logs for a single date.

## When
- The domain scoring engine evaluates daily and goal progress from those logs.

## Then
- Scores are normalized to a 0-100 range.
- Weighted overall progress is deterministic from policy inputs.
- Calendar summary metadata is derived from daily score status.
